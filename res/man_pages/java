NAME
       java - an object-oriented language

DESCRIPTION
       Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
       that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
       It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers
       write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
       platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

SYNTAX
       
    IF STATEMENT

        if (variable1 ==|<|<=|>|>=|!= variable2){
            // Do something
        } else {
            // Do something else
        }

    FOR LOOPS
    
        for (int i = 0; i < variable; i++){
            // Do something
        }
        
    WHILE LOOPS
    
        boolean condition = true;
        
        while (condition){
            // Do something
        }
    
    TABLES
    
        int[] myTable = new int[]{0,1,2,3,4,5};
        
        myTable[x]; // Returns the element at the index x of this table
    
    ARRAYLISTS

        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>;
        
        list.get(x); // Returns the element at the index x of this ArrayList
