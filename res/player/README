| Welcome to the shell.             |
|                                   |
| If you see this, that means that  |
| the game has crashed and is       |
| now corrupted.                    |
|                                   |
| You have 45 minutes to fix it     |
| using bash commands.              |
| (Type 'man' for help)             |
|                                   |
| If it's not done in 45 minutes,   |
| the game will restart and you     |
| will stay here forever.           |
| (Type 'timer' to see the timer)   |
|                                   |
| Good luck.                        |
|                                   |
